- 👋 Hello. I'm Muku6, also known as Heather in the real world.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... reading, art, web development, and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript! Also about GitHub as it seems some places of employment would like that!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure if collaborating right now, as I'm learning. But maybe in the future!
- 📫 You can reach me on here or via email at irisdrakon@yahoo.com.
